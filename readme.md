# CS 3220 Assembler - Project 2

Assembler written in Python3.

Usage: `python assembler.py inputFilePath outputFilePath`


## Testing

There is a unit test file in the `tests` directory that runs the assembler on the example input files and compares them to their expected outputs.

The Nose package must be installed:

~~~{.sh}
pip3 install nose
~~~

Run the tests from the `assembler` dir with:

~~~{.sh}
nosetests
~~~
